Allows your commenters to share who they are on Twitter. Like Gravatar, Tweetluv works globally — no database changes needed!

== Description ==

Tweetluv makes it easier for people to find & follow you on Twitter.

It's totally free, there's no account to manage, and it takes around 6 seconds to set it up.

It's like Gravatar meets CommentLuv meets Twitter.

== Installation ==

1. Upload 'tweetluv.php' to the '/wp-content/plugins/' directory
1. Activate the plugin through the 'Plugins' menu in WordPress
1. That's it!

== Screenshots ==

1. The default form is really simple.
2. Your commenter simply enters their Twitter username ...
3. and their e-mail address. That's it. From then on, their info will be pulled automatically, and they won't need to do anything. It's a set-it-and-forget-it kind of thing.

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= Does this affect my blog's database? =

No! Just like Gravatar, all data is stored remotely. This means your blog loads faster, with less strain. Also, once your readers sign up once, they never have to sign up again.

= What is it? =

Tweetluv is a way for the blogs you comment on to show your Twitter account, so other blog readers can find and follow you on Twitter.

= How does it work? =

Tweetluv is a simple service.

A blog says "Hey, do you have a Twitter account associated with *this e-mail address*?"

We look in our system, and if there's a Twitter username for that e-mail, we give it to the blog to display.

If people see your comment on a blog and they like what you say, they might then follow you on Twitter.

It's a totally safe, totally easy way to connect the things you say on blogs with the things you say on Twitter.

= Why would I want to connect my e-mail address to my Twitter account? =

So people can find and follow you on Twitter!

= Is this free? =

It's totally free.

= Can I get spam from this? =

Absolutely not. We don't share your e-mail address with anybody, and your e-mail address (and your readers' e-mail addresses) are encrypted. The only way someone can find out your Twitter username is if they already know your e-mail address.

(For the developers out there, it's a key-value store, with the hashed e-mail as the key, the Twitter username as the value. The e-mail address isn't accessible.)

= Is Tweetluv going to post something on my Twitter stream? =

Absolutely not. We have no way of posting to your Twitter stream. And even if we did, we wouldn't. We don't like it when services do that.

= Why isn't this a service offered by Twitter themselves? =

It used to be. You used to be able to input an e-mail address and find that person's Twitter account. They discontinued it, though. We felt like it was a valuable service, though, so we built this.

= I have a question that isn't answered here. How can I contact you? =

Just send an e-mail to charlie@monotask.com, and I'll get back to you right away. Tweetluv is one of my top priorities right now, so I really want to hear from people getting it set up on their blogs.
